# MVP of the Netflix Dataset
- In this folder, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is provided. 
- This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix.
- The Dataset Contains : 7787 rows and 12 columns

# The Project summarizes the following Analysis:

- Exploring the Data
- Check the variables that contains missing values
- Clean and Correct the missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with Pandas for modelisation
- Feature Selection
- Predctive Machine Learning Modeling
- 
# Some Key Results:

## Figure 1: Distribution of the data based on type criteria.

Figure 1 shows how the data is distributed between Movies and TV Shows, 30.3% of this data are TV Shows and 69.7% are Movies.

## Figure 2: The evolution of number of Movies and TV Shows based on release data

The evolution of streaming contain in netflx according the dataset has inceased rapidely from 2015 and contnue to grow exponentially.

# Predictive Modeling using Machine Learning
In the project we used Three types of models: K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Logistic Regression

According the Figure 3 we see that using Random Forest Algorithm gives a high acurracy results compared to KNN Algorithm Logistic Regression.
